Again, this is not strictly necessary, but it makes life simpler. For example, the class will track useful information internally (e.g. `input_size`, `n_layers`). We can also create convenience functions such as `init_hidden()` to create a fresh hidden layer without having to remember what the precise dimensions ought to be. \n",

This is where we initialize variables with the correct values, and instantiate the machine learning layers. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Notice the Tensorflow GRU module is called here (which is the heart of our model). We also include an [\"embedding\" layer](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-embeddings-explained-4d028e6f0526), which learns to represent our integer inputs (remember we converted our sequence of characters into a sequence of integers using the `encode_seq()` function) as a vector of foating point numbers. That vector of floating point numbers serves as the input to our GRU. Finally, we instantiate a `Linear` and `LogSoftMax` layer, both of which convert the GRU output into a sequence of log probabilities. \n",

    "The `forward()` function is where we actually *use* the layers we created with `__init()`. In `forward()` we take an input and cascade it through the layers to produce an output. The key to any kind of deep learning project is to carefully track the input and output dimensions of your layers. Notice my comments to help myself mentally track what each layer is spitting out, and what the next layer expects. It helps to be aware of the [`transpose()` function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.transpose.html), which allows you to rotate two dimensions. This helps to match a tensor with the input expections of a layer. "

In other words, the more probability the model assigns to the correct category, the more the the model is \"rewarded\". \n",

The training data also has the answer generated by the HMM to which the model can compare its prediction. The more probability assigned to the correct category, the more the current model weights are reinforced.\n",

The training process proceeds to loop through the data set in a random order (because we set the `shuffle` parameter on our Dataloader to `True`). A full loop through the data is called an \"epoch\". Within each epoch, we iterate through every training batch (in this case, batches are just one sequence long). Before feeding a sequence to our RNN, we reset the hidden state and the gradient. We then feed the training sequence to our model, and collect the prediction output. The output is then reorganized (using `transpose()`) to match the input expections of our NLLLoss function. Once we get a loss value, we call `backward()` to calculate derivatives, and which are fed to the optimization function, which updates the model weights. It's remarkable how much PyTorch keeps track of for us.\n",
